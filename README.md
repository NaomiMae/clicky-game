## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions


1. The application renders different images of Beyonce to the screen.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image of Beyonce for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
